# Spotify Web AI DJ - client side agentic smarts for advanced user experiences

A Web AI Agent running entirely client side in browser, that's capable of controlling generating a spotify playlist using function calling to get the job done using Google's Gemma 2 (2B) model in JavaScript via WebGPU thanks to the MediaPipe Web LLM library, combined with some extra function calling logic to enable advanced user experiences.

## Prerequisites

* Chrome - as the LLM is accelerated using WebGPU
* A computer with a GPU - most will work so long as 4.5GB VRAM, but if you have a dedicated GPU it will be much faster.
* The model file is a 2.5GB download! Be patient.
